# Check-It
Check-It is a clean, minimalist to-do list web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks â€” with data saved in the browser using localStorage.

This project was based on a YouTube tutorial by CodingLab, but includes my own customized styling and structure:
- A fully redesigned minimalist dark UI
- Subtle animations and hover effects
- A custom footer with attribution for the icons used

** Features **
- Add, mark, and remove tasks
- Data persists using localStorage
- Responsive, clean layout
- Custom footer with credits

** Tech Stack **
- HTML5
- CSS3 (custom design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
